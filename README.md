Waste Management System for the public.

### ~~Waste is managable.~~

## Problem
---

1. With rapid urbanisation, the country is facing massive waste management challenge. Over 377 million urban people live in 7,935 towns and cities and generate 62 million tonnes of municipal solid waste per annum. 
2. Only 43 million tonnes (MT) of the waste is collected, 11.9 MT is treated and 31 MT is dumped in landfill sites. Solid Waste Management (SWM) is one among the basic essential services provided by municipal authorities in the country to keep urban centres clean. 
3. However, almost all municipal authorities deposit solid waste at a dumpyard within or outside the city haphazardly. Experts believe that India is following a flawed system of waste disposal and management.

## Solution
---
- Innovation

We wanted to build something that would help in the betterment of the environment.

- Functions 

>1. This app has a daily waste management goal which motivates the user to dump, reduce and recycle waste.
2. It also has a button for different articles on the internet from which the user can learn about waste management. 
3. Another function of our app is the use of google maps which shows the user his/her location and nearby location of degradable and non-degradable dustbins.
4. We also have a contact feature from which the user can contact the government organizations and NGO's which can help in rectifying the environment.

- Tech Stack

We created this app using Python which was used to develop the GUI with the help of TKinter library.
We added the google maps using the gmplot module.
